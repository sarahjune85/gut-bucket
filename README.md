## Project Status: Work in Progess

## Room for Improvement

This project presented many challenges.
React Router and Firebase both had recent major updates which presented challenges for working with documentation.
If we were to restart this project, we would use React functional components almost entirely as React Router v6 uses Hooks exclusively.

Room for improvement:

- Routes in React need to be reconfigured
- Architecture of components in React

To do:

- Google Places venue query returns a photo
- Notes function for trips and venues
- Expansion of venue info stored in the Database
- User profiles and achievements
- Dates for trip
- Ability to allocate venues into specific timeslots (e.g particular venue for lunch, dinner etc)
- Venue reviews
- Sharing trips between users
