## Project Status: _Work in Progress_

## Room for Improvement

This project presented many challenges, as we were mostly unfamiliar with all 3 technologies implemented (React, Googles Places API, Firebase/FireStore), and we were a little too ambitious with what we could achieve in a week. However - we had a good crack at it, and learnt a lot along the way!

We became very familiar with noSQL databases, the importance of knowing your package versions, nesting data, splitting functions up, async functions...and how unintentional recursion can cause you to blow through 3 free Firestore database read quotas in a day. ðŸ™ˆ

React Router and Firebase both had recent major updates which presented challenges for working with documentation.
If we were to restart this project, we would use React functional components almost entirely, as React Router v6 uses Hooks exclusively.

## Room for improvement:

- React Router components need to be reconfigured, currently does not redirect on signin.
- Implement Firebase v9
- Architecture of components in React

## To do:

- Google Places venue query returns a photo
- Notes function for trips and venues
- Expansion of venue info stored in the Database
- User profiles and achievements
- Dates for trip
- Ability to allocate venues into specific timeslots (e.g particular venue for lunch, dinner etc)
- Venue reviews
- Sharing trips between users
